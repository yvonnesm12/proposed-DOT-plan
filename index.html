        <p>BROOKLYN, NY — The Department of Transportation wants to remake 7th and 8th Avenues, between 39th and 66th St, into one-way streets to make them safer for roadway users. The proposed plan would make 7th Ave into a southbound one-way street and 8th Ave into a northbound one-way street. Both streets would get protected bike lanes. </p>

        <p>In 2019, 8th Ave, a busy commercial street in the heart of Brooklyn’s Chinatown, was identified as a Vision Zero priority corridor. Between 2014 and 2018, 8th Ave contributed to one pedestrian fatality, 17 severe injuries to pedestrians and 15 severe injuries to motorists, according to DOT data. According to CrashMapper data, there have been two pedestrian fatalities and 188 total injuries to cyclists, pedestrians and motorists in the corridor since January 2019. </p>

        <p>Let’s take a closer look at the problems and the proposed solutions to fix the issue.</p>

            <p><b>The Problem:</b> 43% of pedestrians feel very unsafe or somewhat unsafe walking on 7th and 8th Ave, according to a DOT survey. In addition, 78% of respondents felt that the sidewalks are too crowded. As an example, more than 5,000 pedestrians were counted in one hour on 8th Ave & 57th St in September 2019.
<p><b>The Solution:</b> Expanding sidewalks on the west curb of 8th Ave from 60th St to 51st St.</p>

            <p><b>The Problem:</b> 54% of cyclists feel unsafe biking on 7th Ave and 8th Ave, according to a DOT survey. A lack of designated bikes lanes have led to a high frequency of failure to yield crashes.</p>

<p><b>The Solution:</b> Creating protected bike lanes that would provide a north/south connection to Sunset Park.</p>

            <p><b>The Problem:</b> Sideswipes and head-on collisions are 50% more frequent on these corridors compared to the rest of Brooklyn. Double parking coupled with frequent loading from trucks result in lane blockages, reducing the road to one travel lane. Traffic congestion leads to unpredictable movements and injuries. </p>

<p><b>The Solution:</b> Eliminating two-way traffic would improve vehicle predictability. </p>

<p>However, business owners in the area are decrying the net loss of 200 parking spots outlined in the proposal. </p>

            <p><b>The Problem:</b> The B70 bus stops every 400 to 700 feet, which is below MTA spacing guidelines. Bus speeds are less than 4 miles per hour going down the corridors.</p>

<p><b>The Solution:</b> Relocating southbound B70 bus from 8th Ave to 7th Ave and consolidate bus stops.</p>

<p>However, business owners say rerouting the bus hinders businesses. </p>
